### This is the main repository of the Analysis and Visualization of Complex Data Course of GreenDS MSC programme.
#### All the exercises will be exchanged between the students and the lecturer using this repository. It will eventually also be used as the version control of code created in the classes.

#### NOTE: the class presentations will be available on [fenix](https://fenix.isa.ulisboa.pt/)
