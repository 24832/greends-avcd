### This is the main repository of the Analysis and Visualization of Complex Data Course of GreenDS MSc programme.
#### All the exercises will be exchanged between the students and the lecturer using this repository. It will eventually also be used as the version control of code files created during the classes.

#### Other platforms that we will use to exchange information include:

- the class presentations will be available on [fenix](https://fenix.isa.ulisboa.pt/)

- additional supporting materials such as book copies will be made available at a google drive.

- discord will be used by students and the lecturer to communicate with each other
